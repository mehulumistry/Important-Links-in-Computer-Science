### What is Agile? ###

It is just a mindset. Scrum comes under agile mindset. 
Scrum is the process or way of delivering the business requirements in a fully functional product.

Scrum is a practice that is a subset of Agile. Think of Agile as a car brand, like Toyota, and Scrum as a model, like a Camry. It is a way to implement the Agile principles by way of a project management system that helps teams accomplish their objectives. Scrum focuses on using visual tools to break down a large development project into smaller steps that are accomplished in sets, called Scrum Sprints.

Loops are also refer as iteration.

### WHICH ONE IS BETTER? AGILE VS WATERFALL ###
Agile and Waterfall are such opposites that it’s hard to say which one is better. It really depends on the project, the level of clarity around requirements, and how flexible you can be.

If you have a clear picture of what the final product should be, you have fixed requirements that won’t change, and you’re working on a relatively simple project, some argue that Waterfall is a better choice than Agile. If you don’t expect to deal with change, Waterfall is a straightforward, efficient process. The issues with Waterfall come when you have to accommodate changes.

If you don’t have a clear picture of the final product, you anticipate changes, and you’re working on a complex project, Agile is superior. Agile is designed to accommodate new, evolving requirements any time during the project, whereas Waterfall does not allow you to go back to a completed phase and make changes.

### Difference between Agile and Waterfall

* Waterfall model is ideal for projects which have defined requirements, and no changes are expected. On the other hand, Agile is best suited where there is a higher chance of frequent requirement changes.
* The waterfall is easy to manage, sequential, and rigid method.
Agile is very flexible and it possible to make changes in any phase.
* In Agile process, requirements can change frequently. However, in a waterfall model, it is defined only once by the business analyst.
* In Agile Description of project, details can be altered anytime during the SDLC process which is not possible in Waterfall method.

### **1)** Scrum Flow ###

A product backlog might include several types of item:

* User stories
  * ***EPICS*** – larger features that need to be broken down into user stories
  * ***Bugs***
  * ***Spikes*** – tasks which don’t directly generate value like research
